# DJS01: Vanilla JS Podcast App

## Overview

You will design and build a responsive web application that allows users to **browse podcast shows** on a landing page and **view detailed information** in a modal. The application displays clear, concise previews of podcast shows and offers additional information through a modal pop-up, **all without navigating away from the page**. Your app showcases clean code architecture and strong UI/UX design while following JavaScript best practices.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Landing Page – Podcast Previews

- Display a list of podcast shows on the landing page.
- Each podcast preview includes:
  - Cover image
  - Show title
  - Number of seasons
  - Genre names
  - Last updated date (human-readable)
- Cards are fully responsive and prevent overlapping content.
- Long titles or text are truncated to maintain layout.

### 2. Modal View – Show Details

- Clicking on a podcast preview opens a modal.
- The modal includes:
  - Larger cover image
  - Podcast title
  - Description of the show
  - Genre tags
  - Last updated date (readable format)
  - List of season titles
  - Number of episodes per season
- Modal has a clear and accessible close button.

### 3. Code Architecture & Best Practices

- Uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **functional programming principles**.
- Follows **SOLID design principles** for clean, maintainable code.
- Reusable functions abstract repeated logic.
- JSDoc comments included for major functions and modules.

## Technical Requirements

- Built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
- No page reloads: JavaScript handles modal behaviour and data rendering.
- UI states (modal open/close, hover effects, etc.) work smoothly.
- Data is displayed in a **readable and accessible format**.
- Cards and modals are responsive across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

---

## Design & UX Goals

- Visually appealing UI with clear layout and hierarchy.
- Consistent **colour scheme, typography, spacing, and sizing**.
- Accessibility considerations (contrast, font readability, responsive buttons).
- UI follows wireframe references for both Desktop and Mobile views.
